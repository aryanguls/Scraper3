# Scraper3
Scrapping audio from the website

To Run -

1. Clone the repo
2. Run "python3 audioScrapper.py" (after you have seen the samples you can also just delete the audio directory and the json and run it to see how it populates per campaign).
3. The user is prompted to enter either the number of audio files they'd want to look at or enter ALL in case you want it to go through every audio file on the website.
4. Script runs to populate a folder audio_files with the audio files (mp3) and a metadata.json for the corresponding metadata.

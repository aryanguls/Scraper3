# Scraper3
Scrapping audio from the website

To Run -

1. Clone the repo
2. View the samples in the audio_files and the metadata.json (after this just delete the video directory and the json)
3. Run "python3 audioScrapper.py".
4. The user is prompted to enter either the number of audio files they'd want to look at or enter ALL in case you want it to go through every audio file on the website.
5. Script runs to populate a folder audio_files with the audio files (mp3) and a metadata.json for the corresponding metadata.
